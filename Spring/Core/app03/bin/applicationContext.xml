<!-- Q. Is it possible to prepare bean configuration without id attribute?
Ans. YES!!
- In bean configuration, we can provide bean class configuration with “name” attribute and without id attribute.
name attribute will take one or more number of values separated with a  , or ; or space.
- If we provide more than one value then first value is treated as identity for the bean object and the remaining values are treated as alias names to the bean identity.
- Like this alias names can be provided implicitly.
- We can provide alias names explicitly using <alias> tag as well.

NOTE: This is if we do not have an id attribute.
- If id attribute is present, then all the values of name attribute, will be treated as alias names.

Q. Is it possible to prepare bean configuration with both id and name attribute?
Ans. YES!!
id attribute value will be treated as bean identity and name attribute value(s) are treated as bean alias names. -->

    <bean id="hello" name="empBean;empBean1 empBean2,empBean3" class="com.get_tt_right.beans.Employee">  
        <property name="eno" value="111"/>

        <property name="esal" value="1000000"/>
        <property name="eaddr" value="211Handidi"/>
    </bean>
<!-- Like this aliasing is going on explicitly using <alias> tag.
- hello is a.k.a empBean4.
- empBean is a.k.a empBean5.
- empBean4 is a.k.a empBean6.
NOTE: hello is a.k.a empBean4 which is a.k.a empBean which is a.k.a empBean5 which is a.k.a empBean6

/*Define 2 user-defined methods:
1.	initializeBean()
-	Annotate this with @PostConstruct annotation.
-	Inside this method, we are going to provide initializations.
2.	destroyBean() 
-	Annotate this with @PreDestroy annotation.
-	Inside this method we are going to provide de-instantiation||clean-up operations.
We need to tell the container about these annotations.
One way to do this is through Spring Configuration, ApplicationContext.xml file.
We need to make use of a tag: <context:annotation-config/>
Also make sure that your ApplicationContext.xml file has the context namespace as well along with the bean namespace that we have been using in our previous Spring applications in this series.

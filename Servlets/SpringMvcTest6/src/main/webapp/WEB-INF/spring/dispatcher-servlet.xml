<!--Used to perform forward operations in the case of simple hyperlink requests to any form
  - You can use for doing simple page forwards.
  - Like this we are just using UrlFilenameViewController. No need to create your own Implementation of handleInternal method by creating a controller class and extending this UrlFilenameViewController.
  - They have provided for you the implementation, your is just to use it as below.
  - Inside the implementation they have provided for you, based on your request action i.e., hello.ds or hai.ds Check these two inside bookform1.html as we have configured them as hyperlinks.
     +. The action name will be read i.e., hello or hai
     +. This action name will be taken as the page name and will be returned by the Controller implementation they internally implemented for you as part of the MAV object
     +. Based on this name, Dispatcher servlet will then contact the view resolver and return to you the respective page i.e., hello.jsp or hai.jsp
 -->

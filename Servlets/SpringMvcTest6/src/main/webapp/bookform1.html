    <h2>Simple forward operations by implementing HelloController from UrlFileNameController</h2>
<pre>
<!-- Actually you can use direct page extensions like "./hello.jsp", but if you do this; user can be able to read your file location and extension
Therefore to hide file location we can use this forwarding kind of things. i.e., "./hello.ds"
Check dispatcher-servlet.xml file on how we are doing such configurations -->
    <!-- <a href="./hello.jsp">Hello</a> -->
    <a href="./hello.ds">Hello</a>
    <a href="./hai.ds">Hai</a>
